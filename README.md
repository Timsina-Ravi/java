# Java Learning Repository

## Overview
This repository contains my **Core Java learning journey**, focused on building a strong foundation in **Java syntax, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, and backend fundamentals**.  

It serves as a **theory and example reference**, not a full project repository. All practice problems and project-based learning are handled in a separate repository named `Java-Practice-Project`.

---

## Repository Purpose
- Strengthen understanding of **Java fundamentals**  
- Provide **concise reference material** for quick revision  
- Keep **learning and theory separate** from coding practice/projects  

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. Java Basics
- Introduction to programming and Java syntax  
- Java Architecture and JVM internals  
- Data types, variables, operators  

### 2. Control Flow & Methods
- Loops, conditionals, and branching statements  
- Methods: declaration, invocation, parameters, return types  

### 3. Data Structures
- Arrays and Strings  
- StringBuilder  

### 4. Exception Handling
- Try-catch, multiple exceptions, nested try  
- Throwing and propagating exceptions (`throw` and `throws`)  

### 5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Classes and Objects**: constructors, `this` keyword  
- **OOP Principles**: inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction  
- Access modifiers and Object class  

### 6. File Handling
- Reading from and writing to files  
- Basic file operations  

### 7. Collections & Java 8 Features
- Lists, Sets, Maps, Queues  
- Streams, Lambda expressions, Functional interfaces, Optional  

### 8. JDBC
- CRUD operations using JDBC  
- Connecting to databases and executing queries
